# MinimalAtmosphere
A minimal (single cginc file) atmospheric scattering implementation for Unity to use as a base for further work and as a reference for anyone wanting to learn. Includes a simple skybox and object shader. No optimizations are used and so it probably should not be used in an actual application.
The project is using URP (just to get screen tonemapping and dithering) but you can export the atmosphere part to any pipeline, just grab the Atmosphere directory from Assets.
